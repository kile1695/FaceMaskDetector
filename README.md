# FaceMaskDetector

## Introduction

As we all know, COVID-19 has disrupted the lifestyle of the entire population. In order to protect ourselves from this disease, the World Health Organization has recommended the public to wear masks as a measure to suppress transmission while saving lives. Therefore, they become a part of life.

## Problem Statement

In consideration that wearing masks became the norm, the problem we wanted to tackle, in simpler terms, was how to determine if an individual is wearing a mask or not. 

## Design

The project can only be run as a script on a computer. Consequently, users with a Windows or Mac computer would be able to use this project as long as they have package deployer that runs Python and a functional camera.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
